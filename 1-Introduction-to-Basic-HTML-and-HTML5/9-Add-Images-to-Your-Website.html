<!-- In this lesson: You can use the <img> element to add images to your site. <img> is self closing. Attributes are added inside a tag. When src is an attribute of img, it points to the url of the image the element represents. The alt attribute is for text that a) is sent to screen readers and b) is displayed if image fails to load. Every <img> must have an alt attribute, though it may be empty if the image is purely decorative. -->
