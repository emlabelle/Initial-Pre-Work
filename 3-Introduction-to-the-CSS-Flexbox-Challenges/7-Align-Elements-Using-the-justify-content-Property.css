/* In this lesson: "flex-direction" also sets the "main axis" of the container element. For a row, the content "start" is the left side of the container, and the "end" is the right of the container. For a column, "start" is the top of the container and "end" is the bottom. A row-reverse starts at the right side and ends left, and column-reverse starts at the bottom end ends at the top. The "justify-content" property works relatively to this axis. "justify-content: center" aligns all items to the center. "flex-start" pushes items to the "start", flex-end to the "end". "space-between" spaces pushes the first and last items to the extreme ends of the main axis, and spaces the rest of the items evenly inbetween. "space-around" works similarly, but includes space between the first and last items and the edges of the container. */
