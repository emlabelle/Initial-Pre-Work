/* In this lesson: JavaScript recognizes seven different types of data: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

Variables are labels that point to a piece of data, allowing you to store and manipulate it by invoking the variable's name. They are declared with "var" and a name made up of letters, numbers, $ or _ (with no spaces, and never starting with a number).

In JavaScript, statements end with semicolons.

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
