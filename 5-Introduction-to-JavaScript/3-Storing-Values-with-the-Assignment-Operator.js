/* In this lesson: A single equals sign is the "assignment operator", used to assign a value to a variable. If a statement to the right of the assignment operator needs to be resolved, it happens before the assignment (i.e, a statement of 1 + 1 will assign a value of 2).

The value of one variable can be assigned to another. */

// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;
