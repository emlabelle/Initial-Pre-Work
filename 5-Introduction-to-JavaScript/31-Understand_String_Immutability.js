// In this lesson: Bracket notation can't be used to change characters in strings, because strings are immutable once created. To change the value of a string variable, you must assign it a new string literal.

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me
