// In this lesson: Using the same method, you can find the second to last, third to last or nth to last character by continuing to subtract from variable.length.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
