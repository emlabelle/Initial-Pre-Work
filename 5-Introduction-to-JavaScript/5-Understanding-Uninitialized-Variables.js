// In this lesson: A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value has a value of "undefined". Attempting to use this variable will result in "NaN" (not a number) for a mathmatical operation, or the string "undefined" for a string operation.

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
