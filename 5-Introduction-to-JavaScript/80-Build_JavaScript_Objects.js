// In this lesson: A JavaScript object is a structured way to store data where it can be accessed with strings called "properties" (similar to accessing data in an array with the index). JavaScript will automatically interpret properties as strings, so you can use numbers or single words with no quotes as properties too.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Cloe",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["many"]
};
