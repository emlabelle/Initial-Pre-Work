// In this lesson: To access data in an object, you can use bracket notation like an array, or you can use dot notation if you know the name of the property you're trying to access.

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
