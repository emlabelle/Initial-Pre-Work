// In this lesson: A do while loop is similar to a while loop, but it will always DO one iteration of the loop before checking whether its condition is true.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

while (i < 5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
